--------------------------------------------------
##### COMPLETED:
- [X] Base structure
- [X] Prepare JavaScript (done, but never complete)
- [X] Keep score with innerHTML & title writes (writeAll function)
- [X] Implemented multiplier
- [X] Show the value of the multiplier bonus (starting at an initial 1x rate)
- [X] Increase the cost of additional multipliers (multiCost = multiCost * 1.5)
- [X] Added if/else to disable/enable the multiplier button
